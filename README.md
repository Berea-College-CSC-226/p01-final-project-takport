## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

️**Title**: `NettSpend's Playhouse`

  **Purpose**: `My project will run an interactive game that the user can play.`

️**Source Assignment(s)**: `T11: The Legends of Tuna: Breath of Catnip, HW02: Loopy Turtles, Loopy Languages`

️**CRC Card(s)**:
![CRC Card-1.png](CRC%20Card-1.png)
![CRC Card-2.png](CRC%20Card-2.png)
![CRC Card-3.png](CRC%20Card-3.png)  


Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments: 

```
    Branch 1 name: takport
    Branch 2 name: _____________
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue


Reflect on what you’ve done so far. How’s it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    I've started creathing the objects I'm going to need for my video games. I have some of the methods laid out, that
    just need to be filled in with code. I've also created a small unit test as well, I think I'm struggling on that a 
    little bit. I am feeling ahead because I spent a lot of time coding and knowing what I want to do with my project.
    I am worried about the unit test because I felt like I did that wrong. What surprised me so far is that I can add 
    pictures of my choice to my video game. I am feeling really good about this project. I just need to keep working
    on schedule and plan ahead to get more coding done.
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

️**Completion Percentage**: `80%`

️**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    I feel very confident in completing this project, because I am having a fun time creating a game that I envisioned.
    I am learning more as I progress through the project and understanding how some fundamental concepts work. With more
    time in this project, I feel like I am becoming a better programmer and growing my confidence with coding. Some strategies
    that I can employ to increase the likelihood of me being successful in completing the project before the deadline is creating 
    a design and outline of my project, planning ahead, and having my code reviewed by my peers who could suggest feedback for me
    to improve. I can also create a schedule for me to work on the code and unit test.

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### User Instructions
In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 
```
To use this program, start by waiting for the "Enter Your Name" prompt to appear on the screen. This is where you 
will input your name to be displayed on the leaderboard. Type in your name using your keyboard, and then press the 
"Enter" key to submit it. Once you've entered your name, the game will begin. You will see a car at the bottom of 
the screen, and trucks will start moving across the screen from either side. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard 
to move the car left and right, avoiding the trucks as they move across the screen. The game will continue until 
you collide with a truck, at which point the game will end and your score will be displayed on the screen. Music 
will also play while the game runs, until you collide with the truck. Your score will also be added to the leaderboard, 
which will be displayed on the screen for a few seconds before the game window closes.

```
### Errors and Constraints
Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### Reflection
In three to four well-written paragraphs, address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- (For partners) How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?
